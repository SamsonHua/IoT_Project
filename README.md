#Hello, Welcome to my first IoT project where I experiment IoT applications using the popular board the NodeMCU
This program uses the Sinric integration for Alexa which allows seamless and easy integration with the NodeMCU board
This program is for converting my heater into a Smart Heater that can be controlled with an Amazon Alexa. 
Please see my portfolio for more details about this project!
